# mediatr-sample

A simple C# console program to demonstrate the usage of requests, handlers and (pipeline) behaviors of [jbogards's Mediatr](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) library.

### Running the sample

Execute the command `dotnet run` in the project's root folder, provided you have [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.

### Further reading

MediatR's library is a great resource when you are trying to build an application with the CQRS pattern. Martin Fowler has a [great article](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) about this subject.

### Contributions
Contributions to this repo are welcome, specially concerning other aspects of the MediatR library, such as notifications and events.
